## Features

*   **Powerful CLI**: A modern command-line interface built with `Typer` and `Rich` for a great user experience, including beautiful output, progress bars, and table formatting.
*   **Comprehensive Data Processing**: Includes processors for handling single data items, batch processing from files, and both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
*   **Flexible Configuration**: Manage application settings through configuration files (`.json`, `.yaml`) or environment variables. Includes commands to create, show, and validate configurations.
*   **Extensible Data Models**: Utilizes Pydantic-style data models for robust data validation, serialization, and clear schema definition.
*   **Plugin Architecture**: Supports custom plugins via entry points for extending functionality.
*   **Utility Toolkit**: A rich set of utility functions and decorators for caching, retries, performance monitoring, and data validation.

## Installation

### From PyPI

You can install the project directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install sample-project
```

### For Development

To install the project for development, clone the repository and install it in editable mode with development dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/sample-project.git
cd sample-project
pip install -e .[dev]
```

---

## Usage

The `sample-project` can be used both as a command-line tool and as a Python library in your own applications.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The project provides a powerful CLI accessible via the `sample-project` command. You can see all available commands by running:

```bash
sample-project --help
```

#### Process Data

Process a single piece of data. The tool can intelligently handle different input types.

```bash
# Process a simple string
sample-project process "Hello World" --debug

# Process a JSON string with a specific processor
sample-project process '{"name": "test", "value": 42}' --processor-type data

# Save the output to a file
sample-project process "batch data" --save results.json
```

#### Batch Processing

Process multiple data items from a file (`.json` or `.jsonl`).

```bash
# Process a JSONL file and save the output
sample-project batch data.jsonl --output results.json

# Process a JSON file with a limit and no progress bar
sample-project batch data.json --max-items 50 --no-show-progress
```

#### Manage Configuration

Create, view, and validate configuration files.

```bash
# Show the configuration from a specific file
sample-project config show --file my_config.json

# Create a new configuration file with custom settings
sample-project config create --file new_config.json --debug --max-items 200

# Validate an existing configuration file
sample-project config validate --file production.json
```

#### View Statistics

Display processing statistics, such as items processed and cache size.

```bash
# Show statistics for the default processor
sample-project stats --processor-type sample

# Reset all statistics
sample-project stats --reset
```

#### Interactive Mode

Start a REPL-like interactive session for quick experiments.

```bash
sample-project interactive
```
```
Welcome to Sample Project Interactive Mode!
Type 'help' for available commands, 'exit' to quit.

[bold blue]sample-project>[/bold blue] Hello there!
Result:
{
  "success": true,
  "content": "Processed: Hello there!",
  "error": null,
  // ... metadata
}
```

### As a Python Library

You can also import and use the project's components in your own Python code.

```python
from sample_project import SampleProcessor, Config
from sample_project.models import DataModel

# 1. Initialize with a custom configuration
config = Config(debug=True, max_items=100)
processor = SampleProcessor(config)

# 2. Create a data model instance
data = DataModel(name="test_entity", value=42, description="An example entity")

# 3. Process the data
result = processor.process(data)

# 4. Print the result
if result.is_success():
    print("Processing successful!")
    print(result.to_json(indent=2))
else:
    print(f"Processing failed: {result.error}")
```

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard structure for Python applications, separating concerns into distinct modules.

```

├── cli.py              # Command-line interface logic using Typer and Rich.
├── config.py           # Configuration management (loading, validation, models).
├── main.py             # Core business logic and primary data processors.
├── models.py           # Pydantic-style data models and schemas.
└── utils.py            # Common utility functions, decorators, and helpers.
```

-   **`cli.py`**: Command-line interface for the Sample Project.
-   **`config.py`**: Configuration management for the Sample Project.
-   **`main.py`**: Core business logic and main processing classes.
-   **`models.py`**: Data models and schemas for the Sample Project.

## API Documentation

This section provides a high-level overview of the most important classes. For detailed information, please refer to the docstrings within the source code.

### Core Classes

#### `main.SampleProcessor`

The main processor class for handling various data processing tasks. It can handle different types of input data and apply transformations based on configuration settings.

**Example:**
```python
>>> config = Config(debug=True, max_items=100)
>>> processor = SampleProcessor(config)
>>> result = processor.process("Hello World")
>>> print(result.content)
Processed: Hello World
```

#### `config.Config`

Manages all configuration settings for the project, including processing parameters, system settings, and feature flags. Settings can be loaded from files, environment variables, or set at runtime.

**Example:**
```python
>>> config = Config(debug=True, max_items=50)
>>> config.debug
True
```

#### `models.DataModel`

The primary data model for representing business entities. This model is used throughout the application for processing and storage, and includes validation logic.

**Example:**
```python
>>> model = DataModel(
...     name="test_entity",
...     value=42,
...     description="A test entity",
...     tags=["test", "example"]
... )
>>> model.validate()
True
```

#### `models.ResultModel`

A model for representing the outcome of a processing operation. It encapsulates the success status, processed content, error messages, and any relevant metadata.

**Example:**
```python
>>> result = ResultModel(
...     success=True,
...     content="Processed data",
...     metadata={"processor": "SampleProcessor"}
... )
>>> result.success
True
```
